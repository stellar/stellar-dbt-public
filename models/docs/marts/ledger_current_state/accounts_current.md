[comment]: < Accounts Current -

{% docs accounts_current %}

The `accounts_current` table is a nightly snapshotted table that represents the current state of account ledger entries. The table returns the latest account entry, which is defined as the highest `last_modified_ledger` per account on the Stellar Network. Deleted accounts are included in the table. For full state history, please use the `accounts` table.

**The `accounts_current` table is only updated nightly. Intraday ledger state changes are not captured in the table.**

As a reminder, account ledger entries store detailed information for a given account, including current account status, preconditions for transaction authorization, security settings and account balance. The balance reported in the accounts table reflects the accountâ€™s XLM balance only. All other asset balances are reported in the `trust_lines` table.
