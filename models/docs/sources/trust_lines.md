[comment]: < Trust_lines -

{% docs trust_lines %}
Trustlines track authorized and deleted lines of trust between an account and assets. This table can be viewed as a subentry to an account because all trustlines must be associated with a single account. The trust line also tracks the balance of the asset held by the account and any buying or selling liabilities on the orderbook for a given account and asset. You do not have to hold a balance of an asset to trust the asset.
