{% docs asset_type %}
The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM.

- Required Field

#### Notes:

XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native'
{% enddocs %}

{% docs asset_id %}
The Farm Hash encoding of Asset Code + Asset Issuer + Asset Type. This field is optimized for cross table joins since integer joins are less expensive than the original asset id components.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs unique_id %}
Current snapshot tables (tables that end in `*_current`) require a singular, unique identifier so that only records that change are updated. This column is a concatenation of the natural keys to create a unique key.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs upstream_insert_ts %}
The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into an upstream table. This field can help identify gaps in data as well as improve rerun capabilities. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs asset_code %}
The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network.

#### Notes:

Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset
{% enddocs %}

{% docs asset_issuer %}
The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs amount %}
The raw number of units of an asset. Precision for an amount is 10^-7 of the asset token. For example, XLM is scaled down to a denomination of a **stroop,** where 10,000,000 stroops = 1 XLM. More information about amount precision can be found [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/assets#amount-precision).

- Required Field
  {% enddocs %}

{% docs price_n %}
The numerator of the precise representation of the buy and sell price of assets on offer (The buy amount desired).

- Required Field

#### Notes:

If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM in exchange for 1 USD, the numerator will be 1.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs price_d %}
The denominator of the precise represenation of the buy and sell price of assets on offer (The sell amount offered).

- Required Field

#### Notes:

If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM in exchange for 1 USD, the numerator will be 1.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs price %}
How many units of buying it takes to get 1 unit of selling. This number is the decimal form of pricen / priced.

- Required Field

#### Notes:

If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM for 1 USD, the price will be 0.10 USD.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs batch_id %}
String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities
{% enddocs %}

{% docs batch_run_date %}
The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs batch_insert_ts %}
The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs address %}
The address of the account. The address is the account's public key encoded in base32. All account addresses start with a `G`
{% enddocs %}

{% docs address_muxed %}
Muxed accounts are embedded into the protocol for convenience and standardization. They distinguish individual accounts that all exist under a single, traditional Stellar account. They combine the familiar GABCâ€¦ address with a 64-bit integer ID. More info can be found on [Stellar Docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/encyclopedia/pooled-accounts-muxed-accounts-memos#muxed-accounts)
{% enddocs %}

{% docs ledger_closed_at %}
The timestamp in UTC when the ledger with this trade was closed.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs contract_id %}
Soroban contract id
{% enddocs %}

{% docs contract_code_hash %}
Soroban contract code hash
{% enddocs %}

{% docs ledger_key_hash %}
Hash of the ledgerKey which is a subset of the ledgerEntry. The subset of ledgerEntry fields depends on ledgerEntryType.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs closed_at %}
Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds
{% enddocs %}
